/**
 * Four steps, once, and every one of them is a thing the tower can actually do.
 *
 * The step that decides the shape of this page is the third, and it is worth
 * being explicit about what it is not. The device does have a pairing window —
 * `POST /api/v1/dashboard/pair` claims a token during a 120 second window that
 * somebody opens by pressing buttons on the device — but **this tower has no
 * client for it**. The registry says so in as many words ("The tower never
 * initiates it"), and re-pairing would mint a new token and invalidate the
 * credential the composer bridge is already using.
 *
 * So the third step describes the mechanism that exists: the token the device
 * already issued is copied into the tower's own secrets directory, and then the
 * tower is pointed at the panel behind the typed `REAL DEVICE` confirmation.
 * Writing the prototype's "a 2-minute window opens, press pair now" would have
 * been a button for an operation with nothing behind it.
 *
 * Nothing on this page is a progress bar over a wizard's own memory: which step
 * you are on is derived, every time, from what the tower reports — whether a
 * passphrase exists, whether an address is set, whether a token is stored,
 * whether the mode is real. Reload it halfway through and it resumes where the
 * *tower* is, not where the page thought you were.
