 * Claim to have woken a sleeping device. There is no such operation: deep
 * sleep powers the Wi-Fi radio down and nothing on the network can reach it.
 * Every response from here says plainly whether the change reached the device
 * or is being held until it next wakes, and the one immediate wake that exists
 * is the button on the device itself.
 *
 * That is why "set-mode" is two outcomes rather than one, and why the pending
 * one is not an error: it is the designed behaviour of a device that is asleep
 * fifty-nine minutes out of sixty.
