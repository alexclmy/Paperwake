/**
 * The device's own answer, plus the tower's honest reading of it. Nothing here

 * never a cached status pretending to be current.
 *
 * **This route does not change anything, and must not.** It reads the device,
 * reads the tower's state, and reports both. It used to also deliver a pending
 * power intent, which meant a GET could PATCH the device's configuration and
 * rewrite the state file — a mutation on a route with no CSRF check, triggered
 * by anything that could cause a browser to issue this GET. Delivery now
 * happens on `POST /api/device/power` (session + CSRF, like every other
 * mutation) and on the background scheduler. What is reported here is
 * `describeIntent`, which runs the same decision and writes nothing, so the
 * sentence a reader sees is the one the next reconcile will act on.
 *
 * `?force=1` marks the read a person asked for — the "Check now" button. Two
 * things follow from it, and neither is a mutation: the read is allowed a
 * longer budget of read-only retries (see `DeviceClient.status`, and the note
 * on MANUAL_STATUS_RETRY_BUDGET_MS for the twenty-second kernel hold-down it
 * has to outlast), and the answer is marked so a test and a reader can tell a
 * deliberate read from a mount.
 *
 * `?observe=0` asks the opposite question: *what do you already know*. No
 * socket is opened, the answer is local files only, and it comes back in under
 * a millisecond whatever the panel is doing. It is what the Device page paints
 * its first frame from, so that a device which takes ten seconds to time out
 * costs ten seconds of a *badge* rather than ten seconds of a blank page. The
 * payload carries `observed: false` and asserts nothing about reachability —
 * see the note on `src/server/device/lastKnown.ts`.
