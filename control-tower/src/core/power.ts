/**
 * The hybrid low-power model, tower side.
 *
 * This file is portable: no Node, no fetch, no filesystem. Everything here is
 * a pure function of its arguments, so the vitest suite drives the awkward
 * states directly instead of trying to reproduce them against a device that
 * is, by design, usually asleep.
 *
 * The one thing this module exists to keep honest
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * **A sleeping device cannot be woken over Wi-Fi.** Deep sleep powers the
 * radio down; there is no socket listening and no packet that can change that.
 * Any UI that offers "wake the device" as a button is lying, and any client
 * that retries a request at a sleeping device is burning battery on the
 * router, not on the device.
 *
 * So the tower does the only honest thing available: it holds the request as
 * an *intent*, tells the user plainly that it is waiting, shows when the
 * device is next expected to call in, and points out that the button on the
 * device is the only immediate wake there is. `planIntent` below is the whole
 * of that logic, and it is what the server route and the scheduler both use.
 *
 * Mirrors the firmware contract in main/common/power_policy.h. The wire names
 * and bounds are duplicated here on purpose: this is a separate process that
 * has to validate before it sends, and the tests on both sides assert the same
 * literals so a drift shows up as a failure rather than as a 400 in the field.

 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR
 * -----------------------------
 * A read that failed says one thing and one thing only: *the tower could not
 * reach the panel just now*. It does not say the panel is asleep. Those were
 * conflated here for the whole of one incident: the status route reports
 * `power: null` whenever a read fails, this function's `always_on` and
 * `interactive` branches therefore never had a power block to look at, and
 * every failed read fell through to `asleep` — "the designed state between
 * refreshes". So a panel that had just been woken with the BOOT button, whose
 * own `/api/v1/dashboard/status` answered `awake: true, mode: interactive` in
 * 55 ms to anything else on the LAN, was reported as sleeping, next to a red
 * UNREACHABLE banner derived from the very same failed read.
 *
 * `asleep` is therefore only ever said on evidence the *device* produced:
 * either it answered and reported `awake: false`, or the last time it answered
 * it said it was running the automatic sleep/wake cycle, or it declared an
 * intention to sleep and armed a timer. Never on silence alone.
 *
 * Every interesting case is one where two words could apply, so the order is
 * the substance:
 *
 *  1. It answered. That is a fact, and it beats everything else — except the
 *     device's own admission that it has not yet taken up what it was asked
 *     for (`pending`), or its own report that it is not awake (`asleep`).
 *  2. It did not answer, and it *owes* us an answer — the mock, a firmware
 *     with no sleep contract, `always_on`, or an interactive window that had
 *     not run out when it last spoke. Silence there is a fault: `unreachable`.
 *  3. It did not answer and the tower has no idea what to expect, or it is
 *     late past the grace. Neither is a fault the tower can assert, so:
 *     `uncertain`.
 *  4. It did not answer, the device's own last word accounts for that, and
 *     something is queued for its next wake: `pending`.
 *  5. It did not answer and the device's own last word accounts for that:
 *     `asleep`, and that is the product working.
 *  6. It did not answer and nothing the device ever said accounts for it:
 *     `uncertain`. This is the case that used to be answered with a confident
 *     `asleep`.
