/**
 * Energy: how much of the time the device is listening, and what that costs.
 *
 * The design constraint that shapes every part of this card: **the device is
 * unreachable most of the time, and nothing here can change that.** A control
 * surface that hid that fact would produce a user who believes their clicks
 * did something, and a device that quietly did not do it.
 *
 * So:
 *  - Not answering is never drawn as an error. It is the normal state.
 *  - There is no "wake device" button, because there is no such operation.
 *    The note explaining why is shown where that button would have been.
 *  - A request that could not be delivered is shown as *pending*, with what it
 *    is waiting for and how to make it happen now (the button on the device).
 *  - Nothing here promises a battery life in days. The measurements do not
 *    exist yet, and the card says that instead of inventing a figure.
 *
 * What changed in the refit is the shape. The three firmware modes used to be
 * a segmented control plus a separate red button, which put "Always awake" —
 * the one choice that costs two orders of magnitude of battery life — either at
 * the same rank as the others or in a fence with the destructive actions. They
 * are now three cards that each state their own cost in the same sentence as
 * their name, because the choice being made is a trade and a list of equal
 * options hides the trade.
 *
 * The three cards are not three firmware modes. `always_on` is one, and the
 * other two are both `auto_saver` at different wake intervals — which is the
 * truth about the hardware: sleeping more and sleeping less is one mode with a
 * number, and the number is what the chips below set.
