/**
 * The shell's copy of "what is the device doing", without a second device read.

 * The shell shows the state badge on every page, and the pages read the device
 * for their own reasons. Having both fetch would double the number of times
 * the tower knocks on a battery-powered panel's door for one page view, which
 * is exactly the kind of cost this product refuses to pay quietly.
 *
 * So there is one module-level reading, and whoever reads the device publishes
 * it here. The shell fetches once on mount, in case the page it is wrapping
 * never reads the device at all (Dashboards, Voice), and otherwise lives off
 * what the pages already know.
 *
 * Nothing here polls the DEVICE. Device contact is the scheduler's job; a
 * browser tab left open overnight must not become a source of traffic aimed at
 * a device that is trying to sleep. What it does poll, while the tab is
 * visible, is the tower's memory of the scheduler's presence watch
 * (`?observe=presence`), which opens no socket — so pressing BOOT on the panel
 * turns the badge to Awake within seconds without anyone clicking "Check now".
