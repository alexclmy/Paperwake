/**
 * The screenshots in docs/images/, made reproducibly.
 *
 * Run by hand, committed as PNGs:
 *
 *     npx tsx tools/screenshots.ts
 *
 * Why a script rather than "take a screenshot when you remember to":
 *
 *  - **It must never photograph somebody's home.** This drives a tower with
 *    its own throwaway data root, pointed at the in-repo mock, with source
 *    fixtures on (NOTE4C_TOWER_E2E=1). No weather for a real place, no
 *    calendar, no Reminders, no LAN address — nothing on the resulting images
 *    is a fact about the machine that produced them.
 *  - **The same content every time.** It seeds one dashboard with fixed
 *    wording, so a re-run produces the same picture and a diff in
 *    docs/images/ means the interface changed, not that the weather did.
 *  - **Both form factors.** 1440x900 and 375x812, the two the README shows and
 *    the two Playwright measures.
 *
 * It starts its own development server, on a port of its own and building into
 * a directory of its own, so it cannot disturb a tower you have running.
 *
 * Every page is also inspected while it is on screen, because a screenshot run
 * already loads each page at each width and a picture does not show a thrown
 * exception, a console error or a font fetched from somebody else's CDN. The
 * four properties are in `Problem` below; what was seen is written to
 * test-results/screenshots-qa.json (ignored, like everything under
 * test-results/) and a run that saw anything fails after writing it.
