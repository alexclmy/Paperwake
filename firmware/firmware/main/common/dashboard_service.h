/**
 * @brief A short, single-claim window during which a new token may be fetched.
 *
 * Why this shape, given the constraint that pairing must be locally initiated
 * and must never be an unauthenticated remote enrollment:
 *
 *  - The window can only be opened by a physical action on the device (the
 *    Settings menu). Nothing reachable over the network opens it.
 *  - It closes on the first successful claim, so a second caller cannot also
 *    obtain the token.
 *  - It expires on its own, so a window left open by mistake does not stay open.
 *  - The token is never drawn on the panel. That matters specifically here:
 *    e-paper holds its last image with the power off, so anything shown on it
 *    is effectively written down and left on the desk.
 *
 * Residual risk, stated rather than hidden: during the open window, another
 * host on the same LAN could claim the token first. The operator sees on the
 * device whether the window was claimed, and can immediately re-pair to
 * invalidate a token that went to the wrong place. This is a deliberate trade
 * against requiring a serial cable for every pairing.

 *
 *  1. **Drain before triggering.** A completion signal from a previous refresh
 *     would otherwise satisfy this wait instantly, and the caller would record
 *     a frame as displayed before the panel had started drawing it.
 *
 *  1a. **Draining is not enough while a refresh is still running.** Draining
 *     removes signals that have already been posted. It cannot remove the one a
 *     refresh that is *in flight right now* is going to post when it finishes,
 *     and that signal arrives within milliseconds of our trigger while the panel
 *     is still showing the other refresh's image. The caller then records our
 *     frame as displayed on the strength of somebody else's completion, and
 *     `panel_ok` describes that other refresh too.
 *
 *     This is reachable on the device: the clock tick, the status bar and the
 *     navigation pump all trigger refreshes from the main task while the
 *     dashboard render task is running this handshake. So when @c panel_busy
 *     reports a refresh already in progress, the handshake waits for it (inside
 *     the same bound), drains again, and only then triggers its own.
 *
 *  2. **Bound the wait.** An unbounded wait on a wedged panel deadlocks the
 *     render task, and every later frame with it.
 *
 *  3. **Never acknowledge on the signal alone.** The driver's read_busy() gives
 *     up after its own timeout and carries on regardless, so "the refresh task
 *     finished" does not imply "the panel drew the frame". Success requires the
 *     signal *and* a clean panel report.
 *
 *  4. **One at a time.** A second concurrent handshake would consume the first
 *     one's signal. Overlapping calls are refused rather than interleaved.
